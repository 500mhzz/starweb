# StarWeb
Starweb is a simple WebUi that uses discord.js to get embeds from a channel and display it on the website with pagintation, its super fast too!

# ENV Setup
```env
TOKEN=DiscordToken
CHANNEL_ID=ChannelID
DISCORD_SERVER_ID=GuildID
```

- CHANNEL_ID is used for the default channel when the user enters the website
- DISCORD_SERVER_ID is the server to fetch the channels from

# NOTE:
Make sure to change the channel ids and names in the +page.svelte file!
